Welcome to Unix::ConfigFile 0.06.  This is an *alpha* release.  That means
that interfaces may change in the future and there will probably be some bugs
lurking around.  You have been warned.

The Unix::ConfigFile distribution is a suite of modules that provide simple
interfaces to various Unix configuration files.  The objective is to free the
system administrator from dealing with the trivial formatting details of the
files, and allow him or her to concentrate on the information therein.
Currently supported files include:

        aliases    Unix::AliasFile
	automount  Unix::AutomountFile
        group      Unix::GroupFile
        passwd     Unix::PasswdFile

You can install this module in the usual way:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

These modules will work with perl 5.004 or higher.  However, the AliasFile
module may exhibit a minor bug under versions less than 5.005; see the
AliasFile documentation for details.  The documentation is embedded in each
module; use perldoc (e.g. perldoc Unix::PasswdFile) after installation to get
started.

module.  To subscribe, send an email with "subscribe" (without the quotes)
